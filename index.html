        Maple<br/>
Domestic Tabby<br/>
D.O.B 30 April 2014<br/>                       <img src="./folder1/cat.png" alt="My image" width="200" height="220" />
      <p>

Maple is registered, micro-chipped, vaccinated & de-sexed.<br/>
Maple is flea treated & wormed at regular intervals in accordance<br/> to vet standards.
She is litter trained & she is leash trained.<br/>

Maple is command trained to “come”, “sit”, “stand” & “high five”<br/>

My Wife and I have a Dyson vacuum cleaner complete with HEPA filtration<br/> system, which can more than handle kitten fur.
The litter tray Maple uses is high edged to prevent potential overspill &<br/> the litter we use is of the highest quality. Catlux Softwood Litter<br/> prevents tracking & neutralises odour. In addition to this we use an<br/> odour neutraliser from Hartz. Liz & I are somewhat sensitive<br/> to odours & as such do not tolerate any products that are not effective.

My Wife and I have had cats for the most part of our renting career and at <br/>no point have our skills in animal care, nor our ability to maintain<br/> a property whilst in the care of a pet, ever been a concern to<br/> a property owner, strata body or realty agent.
I am confident that with our impeccable track record, this will continue to<br/> be the case.
